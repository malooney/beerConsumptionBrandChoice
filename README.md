# beerConsumptionBrandChoice

```r

The best way to install this package is to downlowd the Source Ball file 
located in the "source_ball" directory. Once you have the source file on your
computer use the install feature in RStudio and use the "install from" tab to
install from "Package Archive File (.tgz; tar.gz)".

If you do not use the obove method to install the package then copy and paste
the section below into your R console. The data files listed in "inst/extdata"
will need to be installed manually, which is not ideal. For the package to work
properly you will need these files.

# If you do not already have devtools installed, install it...

if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

# To install the package:

devtools::install_github("malooney/beerConsumptionBrandChoice")

library(beerConsumptionBrandChoice)

```
